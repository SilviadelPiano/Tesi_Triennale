# Tesi_Triennale
Dear reader,  
this is the repository I used to work on my bachelor degree's thesis, which was written in Latex.  
The PDF file of the thesis is in the "Documento" folder, this is the direct link: [Tesi PDF](https://github.com/SilviadelPiano/Tesi_Triennale/blob/master/Documento/relazione_delPiano_Silvia_1759992.pdf).  
Please, note that the thesis is written in Italian, since the degree was taught in this language.  

The repository of the project, where the code is stored, is this: [HiSchool repository](https://github.com/SilviadelPiano/HiSchool.git).  
In its README you can also find the basic information about the project and the technologies used. For a deeper reading, it's all explained in the thesis.  

Best regards.
